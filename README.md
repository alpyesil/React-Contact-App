# Patika.dev - React ToDo App (Assignment 1)
This is part of a front-end course I'm currently taking on the [patika.dev](https://app.patika.dev/) platform.
It's a simple to-do app using vanilla React. All the comments are written in Turkish.

## Install

```

Then, install all the dependencies:
```
    npm i
